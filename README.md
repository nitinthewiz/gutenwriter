Welcome to GutenWriter.

# What is this?
This is WordPress' Gutenberg Block Editor, freed from the WordPress space, as a standalone page for you to do your writing, editing, thinking, and tinkering in.

# Does it do everything WordPress/Gutenberg does?
No, it doesn't do *most* things. It fails to embed YouTube, it won't let you upload any files, and anything that needs a proper CMS. But it does let you pull in remote images and the like.

# Why build this?
Well, I recently discovered ["Isolated Block Editor"](https://github.com/Automattic/isolated-block-editor) by Automattic, which is a playground for developers and testers to understand the Gutenberg editor in, outside of the scope of WordPress space. I found it interesting, but bogged down by the node project it was bound in. I wanted a Gutenberg editor that's truly standalone in the browser. This isn't perfect, but it's an attempt.

# I can improve things!
Good! Please send me a PR. I'm open to ideas and to fixing what all is broken.

# Does this save my work?
It saves your work in localStorage, which means it's in your browser. Some browsers are callous with local storage, so if you're using it in, say, Safari, you may lose your data. Treat this as a playground, or a quick space to jot down some thoughts and export them in the Gutenberg Blocks format. Don't treat this as a full on editor.

# Who would you like to thank?
First of all, Automattic, for Isolated Block Editor.
